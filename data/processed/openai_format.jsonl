Once >50% of the cluster vote to delete said down node, it's auto-repair history is deleted from the auto-repair system tables. This cleanup process is important to maintain continuous execution of repair across the entire cluster. If a node goes down, it will no longer perform repair and will not update its repair history in the system tables. However, as it is still present in the auto-repair history table, the down node will still be considered as a candidate to run repair. As a result, it will occupy space in the auto-repair queue and in cases with low auto-repair parallelism may even completely block auto-repair within the cluster. This is exactly what happened on of our small clusters where auto-repair parallelism was just one node at a time. A node got replaced but its repair history did not get cleaned up which caused the entire auto-repair system to grind to a halt. Upon investigation we found out that the root cause lies in the ordering of operations within the auto-repair scheduler: # The scheduler will check when was the last time the local node ran repair. # If that duration is lower than the repair interval, it will immediately short circuit. # Otherwise, it will proceed with computing the auto-repair queue and determining if it's the local node's turn to run repair. Importantly, the auto-repair history cleanup happens inside of the auto-repair queue algorithm. This means that a given node will clean up orphaned entries in auto-repair history only once its repair interval passes. For example: if you use auto-repair parallelism of 1 node and a repair interval of 24 hours, the orphaned data will not get cleaned up for up to 24 hours and consequently auto-repair may get stuck for up to 24 hours as well."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Auto-repair scheduler waits for repair interval to pass before cleaning up orphaned node history"}]}

Background Cassandra includes pending nodes in the write quorum calculation to ensure consistency level guarantees are maintained during topology changes (e.g., bootstrap, node replacement). This is implemented in ConsistencyLevel.blockForWrite() where pending replicas are added to the required blockFor count. h3. Current Behavior When a node is bootstrapping or being added to the cluster, all pending replicas are unconditionally added to the blockFor requirement, regardless of whether they are replacement nodes or new capacity additions.Example with RF=3, CL=LOCAL_QUORUM: * New node bootstrap (increasing capacity): blockFor = 2 (quorum) → with pending = 3 * Node replacement (old node being replaced): blockFor = 2 → with pending = 3 h3. Problem Statement During a node replacement scenario where a pending node is joining to replace an existing node:Current situation: * Natural replicas: A, B, C (C is being replaced) * Pending replica: D (replacement for C) * Live replicas: A, B, D (3 live nodes after C goes down) * Required ACKs: 3 (base quorum of 2 + 1 pending) The issue: # Although we have 3 live replicas capable of responding, the blockFor requirement of 3 is artificially inflated # The pending replica (D) is typically busy during bootstrap and may respond slowly # Even though we've received ACKs from A and B (satisfying quorum of natural replicas), the write blocks waiting for an ACK from the slow pending replica D # This unnecessary dependency on the replacement pending replica's responsiveness causes write timeouts during node replacement operations h3. Root Cause As the original comment in the ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-833 mentioned: {quote} we want to satisfy CL for both the pre- and post-bootstrap nodes (in case bootstrap aborts). This requires treating the old/new range owner as a unit: both D *and* C need to accept the write for it to count towards CL. So rather than considering {A, B, C, D} we should consider {A, B, (C, D)} This is a lot of complexity to introduce. {quote} the current implementation is a \"simplification\" idea. The current implementation conflates natural and pending replicas into a single blockFor calculation: * blockFor = quorum(all replicas including pending) However, the two replica types serve different purposes: * Natural replicas: The authoritative owners of the data (by replication strategy) * Pending replicas: Temporary nodes either adding capacity (new bootstrap) or replacing an existing node (node replacement) The current approach treats all pending nodes identically, but they should be handled differently based on their topology role. h3. Proposed Solution Decouple blockFor calculation into separate requirements for natural and pending replicas:For normal operations and new bootstrap (Keep current behavior as the implementation might be complex and we can do later): * blockFor = quorum(natural replicas) + all pending replicas * This ensures: quorum of natural replicas respond, PLUS any pending nodes respond * Protects against topology change cancellation {color:#de350b}For node replacement:{color} * {color:#de350b}blockFor = quorum(natural replicas) only{color} * {color:#de350b}This ensures: only quorum of natural replicas need to respond{color} * {color:#de350b}Pending replacement node responds when available but is not required{color} * {color:#de350b}Eliminates unnecessary dependency on busy pending replica during replacement{color} h3. Implementation For normal node bootstrap, we will block as what we are doing now as it is too complicate to determine the unit of a (new owner and old owner). For node replacements, as the old node is down, the (new node + old node) unit cannot response the write anyway. We will just block for the consistency level(natural replicas). The implementation should not be complicated as the node replacement relationship is clear."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Unnecessary write timeouts during node replacement due to conservative pending node accounting in consistency level calculations"}]}

While evaluating Cassandra for adoption, I’ve been testing different modes. In the process of exploring features, I considered using TrieMemtable together with the UnifiedCompaction strategy (level). My thought was that combining the two could allow SSTables created from memtables to utilize token ranges much more efficiently, so I’ve been investigating whether this is feasible. During this testing, I noticed that the first SSTable created is always generated as a single file. Because only one SSTable is produced, it ends up covering the entire token range, which I believe is highly inefficient. After digging into the source, I found that the cause seems to be in {{{}org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.unified.Controller#getFlushSizeBytes{}}}: {{double envFlushSize = cfs.metric.flushSizeOnDisk.get();}} For the very first flush, this metric returns {{{}0{}}}, which results in the minimum value of {{1}} being used.

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"Summarize the following technical issue in 2-3 sentences:"},{"role":"user","content":"Simplify upgrade to 5.x by requiring fewer rolling restarts\n\nThe setting {{storage_compatibility_mode}} was introduced by CASSANDRA-14227 to allow a phased transition from cassandra 4.x storage format to cassandra 5.x storage format. The https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/5d83175952dbda3cfca594764841fb3c584fd1ce/conf/cassandra.yaml#L2279-L2281 suggests 3 rolling restarts to upgrade a cluster from 4.X to 5.X: 1. Upgrade cluster to Cassandra 5 with {{storage_compatibility_mode=CASSANDRA_4}} 2. Rolling restart the cluster with {{storage_compatibility_mode=UPGRADING}} 3. Rolling restart the cluster with {{storage_compatibility_mode=NONE}} However this puts additional burden on operators, since it requires 3 restarts to fully upgrade a cluster to 5.x: CASSANDRA_4 -> UPGRADING -> NONE, 2 more than previous upgrade procedures where a single restart was required. Nodes started in *UPGRADING* compatibility mode will be started with Cassandra 5.0 messaging format and sstables, except that they will not accept writes with TTL higher than 2038 which is the limit before 5.x from CASSANDRA-14092 (https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/965a39166cf22f020065578407ca6c585b4a5132/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/rows/Cell.java#L96-L99). The idea is to prevent sending writes with TTLs expiring after 2038 to nodes still in the old version. Once all nodes have been restarted with {{{}storage_compatibility_mode=UPGRADING{}}}, the nodes will start accepting TTLS expiring above 2038. At this stage, if a node is accidentally started in version 4.x or {{storage_compatibility_mode=CASSANDRA_4}}, the node toggles back to accepting only TTLs up to 2038. In order to avoid this, the https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/5d83175952dbda3cfca594764841fb3c584fd1ce/conf/cassandra.yaml#L2279-L2281 suggest restarting the node with {{storage_compatibility_mode=NONE}}. Since *UPGRADING* mode is equivalent to *NONE* once all nodes are upgraded, we could relax the requirement of an additional rolling restart by making the *UPGRADING* state stable once all nodes have been upgraded. That is, even if nodes are restarted in earlier versions, the node would remain accepting TTLs expiring after 2038 similar to the *NONE* mode. After this we could potentially simplify the upgrade instructions to: - Upgrade to 5.x with {{storage_compatibility_mode=CASSANDRA_4}} - Restart with {{storage_compatibility_mode=UPGRADING}} - Upgrade completed, no additional rolling restart needed Alternatively if this turns out to be invasive we can update the instructions to make the third rolling restart optional."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Simplify upgrade to 5.x by requiring fewer rolling restarts"}]}

The code snippet linked, runs into an NPE. I wanted to know from the maintainers and community if this bug/symptom has been seen by them earlier and what might be the best way to handle this? Secondly, I wanted to know the right place for the fix too - whether it should be the application code or the SDK code itself should handle such NPEs and fail more gracefully?

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"Summarize the following technical issue in 2-3 sentences:"},{"role":"user","content":"Query-based MINOR compaction should not consider minOpenWriteId\n\nIn certain scenarios the query-based MINOR compaction produces empty delta file. In ACID tables it will be automatically cleaned up like no compaction happened, but on insert-only tables it causes data loss. This issue happens if there is an aborted and an open transaction on the compacted table. Let’s see an example: * Run an insert which creates delta_0000001_0000001 (writeId=1) * Start an insert and abort the transaction (writeId=2) * Run an insert which creates delta_0000003_0000003 (writeId=3) * Run an insert which creates delta_0000004_0000004 (writeId=4), but before it finishes, start the MINOR compaction * When the compaction is finished the table will contain the following files: delta_0000001_0000003 delta_0000004_0000004 delta_0000004_0000004/000000_0 delta_0000001_0000001 delta_0000001_0000001/000000_0 delta_0000003_0000003 delta_0000001_0000001/000000_0 * It can be seen that the delta_0000001_0000003 directory (which was produced by the compactor) is empty. * When the Cleaner runs, it will remove delta_0000001_0000001 and delta_0000003_0000003, so the data in them will be lost. This happens because of this check in the MINOR compaction: {code:java} long minWriteID = validWriteIdList.getMinOpenWriteId() == null ? 1 : validWriteIdList.getMinOpenWriteId(); long highWatermark = validWriteIdList.getHighWatermark(); List deltas = dir.getCurrentDirectories().stream().filter( delta -> delta.isDeleteDelta() == isDeleteDelta && delta.getMaxWriteId() = minWriteID) .collect(Collectors.toList()); if (deltas.isEmpty()) { query.setLength(0); // no alter query needed; clear StringBuilder return; } {code} If the table has aborted and open transactions, the minOpenWriteId will be set. In the example it will be 4. When the ValidCompactorWriteIdList is created in the TxnUtils.createValidCompactWriteIdList the highWaterMark will be set to minOpenWriteId-1, so this will ensure that the compaction range is below the minOpenWriteId. But in the minor compaction's code the minOpenWriteId is considered as the lower limit, so it wants to compact deltas which are above this values. This is not correct, it seems like a misunderstanding this minOpenWriteId values. In the example the compaction should consider delta_1 and delta_3, but none of them fulfills the conditions \"delta.getMinWriteId() >= minWriteID\" as the minWriteID=minOpenWriteId=4 here. This check in the MINOR compaction code is not correct, I think it is safe to leave out checking against the minOpenWriteId as the highWatermark already adjusted to it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Query-based MINOR compaction should not consider minOpenWriteId"}]}

The only way available today is to identify corrupted files from the table and remove them. Orc-tools is taking a lot of time to find out the corrupt files as it will traverse each file sequentially and show errors for corrupt file. *Proposal:* In spark we have a config, *ignoreCorruptFiles* using which we can read data from rest of the files skipping corrupt files. Can we also implement something like this in Hive as well? We can have a flag to enable this feature which is disabled by default. *Issues:* If we do not fail the queries, corrupt files may accumulate and may cause issues later like size of the table, incorrect results etc.. The reason behind requesting this feature is that it is very difficult to identify faulty/corrupt files easily in a large table/s. So it is also good if we can list all the corrupt files using a simple Hive query, so that they can be deleted without disturbing the actual Hive query flow to skip them"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Skip corrupted files while reading an Orc table"}]}

This feature was introduced in HIVE-19360 for diagnosability purposes to assist in the understanding of the DAG plan with respect to join ordering. However, in most cases when developers want to understand the join order they look into the CBO plan and not in the OPTIMIZED SQL output. Determining the join order from SQL becomes challenging for queries that contain more than a few tables and nested SQL constructs make the situation worse. The CBO RelNode tree is usually easier to navigate. In various cases the SQL serialization is an invalid SQL query. This led people to believe that the CBO plan is wrong. As a consequence, they attempt to fix the CBO plan while in fact the plan is perfectly valid. The bug usually lies only in the serialization part but the latter does not have any effect on the execution of the query. Users (and sometimes developers) believe that the OPTIMIZED SQL is the query that is actually run by Hive. There have been various cases where people copy-paste the OPTIMIZED SQL entry and try to run it when they have issues with the original query and when that fails as well it adds up to the confusion. In addition, since the serializer is buggy it sometimes raises exceptions and the OPTIMIZED SQL does not appear in the output. People will raise bug fixes and invest effort in a feature that is not very useful. Currently, there are 282 .q.out files that use {{EXPLAIN EXTENDED}} and thus contain an entry of OPTIMIZED SQL. Even minor changes in the CBO plan do affect the OPTIMIZED SQL necessitating updates and reviews on multiple files. Typically calcite upgrades trigger many changes in OPTIMIZED SQL. {noformat} $ find . -name \"*.q.out\" -exec grep -a \"OPTIMIZED SQL\" {} \\; | wc -l 820 $ find . -name \"*.q.out\" -exec grep -l \"OPTIMIZED SQL\" {} \\; | wc -l 282 {noformat} I propose to remove the {{OPTIMIZED SQL}} feature and related code to reduce: * maintenance overhead * plan/file (e.g., .q.out) size * users/dev confusion about its meaning/usage"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Remove OPTIMIZED SQL entry from EXPLAIN EXTENDED"}]}

In the KIP, we also mention you have to stop the controller before removing the controller: {noformat} controller.quorum.auto.join.enable: Controls whether a KRaft controller should automatically join the cluster metadata partition for its cluster id. If the configuration is set to true the controller must be stopped before removing the controller with kafka-metadata-quorum remove-controller.{noformat} This is not a user friendly behavior in my opinion. And it will cause many confusion to users and thought there is something wrong in the controller removal. Furthermore, in the kubernetes environment which is controlled by the operator, it is not the cloud native way to shutdown a node, do some operation, then start it up. So, I propose we can improve it by \"the removed controller will not be auto joined before this controller restarted\". That is: 1. Once the controller is removed from voters set, it won't be auto joined even if `controller.quorum.auto.join.enable=true` 2. The controller can be manually join the voters in this state 3. The controller node will be auto join the voters set after node restarted. So basically, the semantics is not changed, it just add some unexpected remove/add loop.

Typically brokers prevent committing offsets for consumer groups that are not in `EMPTY` state by throwing {{{}UnknownMemberIdException{}}}. In addition, {{MirrorCheckpointTask}} has logic in place to prevent committing offsets older than target for {{EMPTY}} consumer groups. However, due to a bug in {{MirrorCheckpointTask}} code, this prevention check is not enforced and it attempts to commit offsets for {{STABLE}} consumers. These calls can go through if consumers were momentarily disconnected moving the group state to {{{}EMPTY{}}}. This results in consumers' offsets getting reset to older values. If the offset is not available on the target broker (due to retention), the consumers can get reset to \"{{{}earliest\"{}}} or \"{{{}latest\"{}}}, thus reading duplicates or skipping messages. h2. *Bug location* 1. In #L305, we only update the latest target cluster offsets ({{{}idleConsumerGroupsOffset{}}}) if target consumer group state is {{{}EMPTY{}}}. 2. When {{syncGroupOffset}} is called, we check if the target consumer group is present in {{{}idleConsumerGroupsOffset{}}}. The consumer group won't be present as it's an active group. We assume that this is a new group and start syncing consumer group offsets to target. These calls fail with {_}{{{{{}Unable to sync offsets for consumer group XYZ. This is likely caused by consumers currently using this group in the target cluster. (org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.MirrorCheckpointTask{}}}}}{_}. When consumers have failed over, the logs typically contain a lot of these messages. These calls can succeed if consumer is momentarily disconnected due to restarts.

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"Summarize the following technical issue in 2-3 sentences:"},{"role":"user","content":"Relax offset commit validation to allow member epochs since assignment\n\nh2. Fencing offset commits In the Kafka protocol, when a consumer commits offsets or a producer tries to add offsets to a transaction, it includes its epoch/generation of the consumer group. The point of this is for the group coordinator to fence against zombie commit requests, that is, commit requests that include an offset for a partition that was since reassigned to a different member. If such a guard was not in place, a zombie offset commit may overwrite offsets of the new owner, or its offsets may be committed to the consumer offset topic but not be included in the result of the new owners offset fetch request. In KIP-848, when receiving an offset commit request that includes the client-side member epoch and a member ID, the group coordinator performs the check {{Client-Side Member Epoch == Broker-Side Member Epoch}} and, if the check fails, returns a {{STALE_MEMBER_EPOCH}} error for regular offset commits and a {{ILLEGAL_GENERATION}} for transactional offset commits. If the member epoch sent in the request is the current broker-side member epoch, KIP-848 guarantees that the partition cannot also be owned by a different member at the same or a larger epoch. Therefore, this is sufficient for fencing zombie commits. Note that we assume zombie commits will always contain offsets for partitions that were owned by the member at the member epoch sent in the request. Commit requests that commit offsets for partitions that are _not_ owned by the member in that epoch, are not possible in a correct client-side implementation of the protocol. Note that the broker-side member epoch is not the group epoch or the target assignment epoch. For details, see KIP-848. Note also that commits can also be fenced because a member falls out of the group (e.g. because it does not revoke partitions within the rebalance timeout). At this point, its commits will be fenced solely based on the member ID (which is not part of the group anymore). We therefore ignore this case in this document, and only consider zombie commits from members that are still part of the group. h2. Downsides of the current approach This fencing is, however, unnecessarily strict. Assume, for example, a member owns P1 at epoch 1. The broker-side member epoch is bumped to 2, but the member still has P1 assigned at epoch 2. The member may not learn about the new broker-side member epoch in time, and submit an offset commit commit for P1 with epoch 1. This is not a zombie commit request as define above (because P1 was not reassigned to a different member), but it will still be rejected by a KIP-848 group coordinator. The trouble with this fencing mechanism is that it is very difficult to avoid the broker-side member epoch being bumped concurrently with an offset commit. Seen from the client-side, the broker-side member epoch may be bumped at any time while a heartbeat to the group coordinator is in-flight. To make sure the member epoch sent in an offset commit request is up-to-date would require making sure that no consumer group or streams group heartbeat request is in-flight at the same time. h2. Why a broker-side fix is warranted This problem is particularly challenging to solve on the client side for transactional offset commits, since they are performed by the producer, not the consumer, and the producer has no way of knowing when a consumer group heartbeat or streams group heartbeat is in-flight. The member epoch is passed from the Java consumer to the Java producer using the {{ConsumerGroupMetadata}} object, which is passed into {{{}sendOffsetsToTransaction{}}}. By the time the transactional offset commit is sent, the member epoch may be stale, the broker will return an {{ILLEGAL_GENERATION}} exception. This will force the Java producer into an abortable error state, surfacing the error as a {{CommitFailedException}} to the user, the user has no other way to recover from this to abort the transaction. This may hurt in any Kafka client application, since aborting transactions means throwing away work and restarting from an earlier point. But it is a particularly big problem in Kafka Streams with exactly-once semantics, where aborting a transaction usually means wiping and restoring the state store, so each aborted transaction means some downtime for apps using state stores of non-negligible size. Furthermore, since Kafka Streams commits every 100ms by default in EOS, this is likely to happen fairly often. h1. Conceptual Design n this design document, we therefore propose to relax the condition for offset commit fencing. h2. Identifying zombies using the last epoch a partition was assigned to the member To derive a more relaxed check, we need to identify an epoch which separates zombie commits from commits of the current owner. As mentioned above, zombie commit requests are commit requests that include a partition, member ID and member epoch combination, so that the member owned the partition at that epoch. However, the partition has since been reassigned to a different member. Most precisely, on the level of a single partition, a relaxed offset commit check can be defined using a *assignment epoch* for each assigned partition and each member, which is the epoch at which the partition was assigned to that member. To fence from zombie commit requests, we can reject all offset commit requests from a member that either does not have the partition assigned, or that includes any member epoch that is smaller or equal than the assignment epoch for that member and that partition. Assignment Epoch Client-Side Member Epoch. h3. Differences to the design above This design does not need to disable commits on the client-side. The need to disable commits came from the fact that we are tracking epochs “imprecisely”, on the member-level and not on the partition-level. So in the RevocationEpoch design, when we have just revoked P2 on the client, we may attempt to commit a partition P1, triggering the race condition because the broker can concurrently bump the revocation epoch for that member because of the revocation of P2. We prevent this by disabling commits while a partition is revoked, and by “while a partition is revoked” I mean the timeframe from executing the revocation on the client, and seeing the following epoch bump on the client. In the partition-level AssignmentEpoch design, if we are committing P1, we are still convinced that we own P1, so we must also still own it on the broker. At the same time, we may remove the assignment epoch for P2 on the broker, but it doesn’t matter since this doesn’t impact whether we can commit P1, and we are not going to try to commit P2 after having revoked it on the client side. h1. Proposed Changes h3. Introducing Per-Member and Per-Partition Assignment Epoch We extend the model of a consumer group / streams group member with one integer per assigned partition for each member of a group. This includes both partitions directly assigned to the member, and partitions pending revocation. The assignment epoch is set to the epoch in which the partition was assigned to the member, and we have the invariant Assignment Epoch <= MemberEpoch <= TargetAssignmentEpoch <= GroupEpoch. The AssignmentEpoch is added as a field to TopicPartitions in ConsumerGroupCurrentMemberAssignmentValue, so that it can be stored and replayed from the committed offsets topic. For streams groups, we will use the same logic but add assignment epochs only for active tasks in StreamsGroupCurrentMemberAssignmentValue, since only active tasks commit offsets in Kafka Streams. h3. Relaxing the offset commit validation We replace the current check offset commit validation check Client-Side Member Epoch == Broker-Side Member Epoch by Assignment Epoch <= Client-Side Member Epoch <= Broker-Side Member Epoch where, for simplicity, we can assume the assignment epoch of a partition that is not assigned to that member to be Integer.maxValue."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Relax offset commit validation to allow member epochs since assignment"}]}

The situation becomes weirder if I remove all connectors from the image except PostgreSQL and MongoDB. In that case, the PostgreSQL connector works perfectly. The plugins are in the folder */kafka/connect* (that is, the only `plugin.path` configured folder), each under a dedicated folder with their dependencies. I then started to add more connectors, and it continued to work until I added the SQL Server connector. To summarize, the problem arises when I put one or all of [sqlserver, spanner,vitess]. The commonality for these connectors seems to be that they support multi-task. The others don't. Am I correct that Kafka Connect guarantees that each connector is loaded with an isolated class loader with its dependencies so that the static emitters should be shared between the Connector and the SMT? To add more, if I run the image from 3.2.0.Final (so Kafka 4.0.0) with all connectors, it works fine. I did other tests, and things are more and more weird. All tests were done with *{{plugin.path=/kafka/connect}}* and *KC 4.1* My original tests were with this directory structure {code:java} /kafka/connect |___ debezium-connector-postgres |___ debezium-connector-mongodb |___ debezium-connector-sqlserver{code} In this case, each connector should be isolated from each others (having a dedicated class loader). In that case, the sharing between the connector and SMT does not work for KC 4.0 Then I tried with {code:java} /kafka/connect |___ debezium-connectors |___ debezium-connector-postgres |___ debezium-connector-mongodb |___ debezium-connector-sqlserver{code} So all connectors are not isolated and share the same class loader. In this case, no issue. And I'll say that this is expected. Then I tried with {code:java} /kafka/connect |___ debezium-connectors | |___ debezium-connector-postgres | |___ debezium-connector-mongodb |___ debezium-connector-sqlserver{code} where *{{postgres}}* and *{{mongodb}}* are not isolated (same classloader) and *{{sqlserver}}* is isolated (different classloader), and in this case, it still works. I expected this to fail as with the first setup. The SMT is in the *debezium-core* jar that and each connector has its own copy So in each connector folder, there are: {code:java} debezium-api-3.3.0.Final.jar debezium-common-3.3.0.Final.jar debezium-connector-[connectorName]-3.3.0.Final.jar debezium-core-3.3.0.Final.jar debezium-openlineage-api-3.3.0.Final.jar{code}"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Weird behavior on Kafka Connect 4.1 class loading"}]}

Background & Motivation Currently, Kafka uses a JSON template-based pre-generation approach to create protocol classes under {{{}org.apache.kafka.common.message{}}}. This solution is mature, stable, and provides excellent multi-language support. However, I've been considering whether we could provide an alternative *compile-time code generation* approach for the Java ecosystem, similar to the AST modification technology used by Lombok. This approach might offer better development experience in certain scenarios. h2. 2. Proposal Overview {*}Core Idea{*}: Use annotation processors to directly modify the AST during compilation, dynamically generating complete implementations of protocol classes instead of pre-generating Java source files. {*}Example Implementation Concept{*}: {code:java} @KafkaMessage(apiKey = 1, version = \"0.1.0\") public class FetchRequestSpec { @ProtocolField(type = \"string\", order = 1) private String groupId; @ProtocolField(type = \"int16\", order = 2) private short acks; // More fields... }{code} h2. 3. Comparative Analysis ||Aspect||Current Template Approach||Compile-time AST Approach||Hybrid Possibility|| |*Development Experience*|Requires viewing generated source files|Cleaner source code, Lombok-like|AST during development, pre-gen for release| |*Build Process*|Explicit pre-generation step|Integrated into standard compilation|Configurable generation strategy| |*Debugging Support*|✅ Full source-level debugging|⚠️ Requires IDE plugin support|Source output on demand| |*Multi-language Support*|✅ Single definition, multiple outputs|❌ Java-only|Preserve existing multi-language capabilities| |*Performance Impact*|One-time generation at build time|Regeneration on each compilation|Smart caching mechanism| h2. 4. Potential Value * {*}Faster Development Iteration{*}: Immediate compilation after protocol definition changes, no pre-generation step required * {*}Source Code Cleanliness{*}: Avoid polluting codebase with大量 generated boilerplate code * {*}Type Safety{*}: Stricter protocol constraint checking at compile time * {*}Alignment with Modern Java Patterns{*}: Similar to Quarkus, Micronaut's compile-time processing philosophy h2. 5. Feasibility Considerations I understand the potential challenges this approach might face: * Compatibility with existing multi-language ecosystem * Ensuring debugging experience * Increased build system complexity * Community learning curve Therefore, I suggest we could: # {*}Offer as Optional Approach{*}: Doesn't disrupt existing workflow, serves as alternative during development # {*}Incremental Implementation{*}: Start with small scope or new modules for experimentation # {*}Toolchain Support{*}: Provide source output mode to ensure debugging capability h2. 6. Next Steps & Recommendations If the community finds this direction interesting, I'm willing to: * Create a Proof of Concept (POC) implementation to demonstrate concrete results * Participate in relevant discussions and design work * Assist with performance benchmarking and compatibility validation Thank you for taking the time to review this proposal. I look forward to further discussing this idea with the community, and whether it is ultimately adopted or not, I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts with the community."},{"role":"assistant","content":"[DISCUSS] Exploring Compile-time AST Generation as an Alternative Approach for Kafka Protocol Classes"}]}

A sample of what zip_longest is doing: {code:java} from itertools import zip_longest rows1 = [ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'] rows2 = [ 'A', 'C', 'D',] zipped = list(zip_longest(rows1, rows2))zipped {code} Result: {code:java} [('A', 'A'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'D'), ('D', None), ('E', None)]{code} So in this case we would have 80% rows failure.
